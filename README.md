# Handouts

## About

The purpose of this repository is to distribute handouts during a SESYNC training event. The content of the handouts branch changes between short courses, but it typically includes the worksheets and data for several lessons. Most trainees will [download] the archive (zip) of this repository during a short course.

## Past Events

**Following** a short course, the worksheets and data will be archived as a zip file. To get the handouts from a past short course: navigate to [releases], select your course by its starting date, and download `Source code (zip)` and `data.zip`. The downloads do not contain a git repositoryâ€”only the worksheets and necessary data.

# Handouts

## About

The purpose of this repository is to assemble handouts for distribution during SESYNC training events. Trainees will [download] the archive of the release folder at the time of a short course.

## Use

make TAG=<top level variable in lessons.yml>

## Past Events

**Following** a short course, the worksheets and data should be archived as a [release]. Configure a new release so the assets are a complete archive of the worksheets and data.

[release]: ../../releases
[download]: ../../archive/latest.zip

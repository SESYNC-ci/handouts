# README.md

A `README.md` file is a very useful component of any project repository. As you can (or will soon) see, it is automatically rendered on GitHub as a simple "homepage" for your project. Instructions for creating your own GitHub repository from these files will be given during the course. Instructions are also summarized in [CONTRIBUTING.md].

## Data

If the repository does not contain a data folder, [download] a zipped data file to accompany the worksheets. A "good" data-synthesis pipeline separates the data from source code with separate storage locations&mdash;we may take a shortcut for these lessons.
